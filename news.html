Lead water supply pipes are an issue that's been around for a very long time. We have ALWAYS removed and replaced with safe plastics any lead water supply pipes we find on sites as a matter of policy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Lead water supply pipes are more likely to be found in houses from the 1950s and 1960s, as the use of lead had began to reduce during the 1970s in our experience, although this does not mean that you shouldn't check your own water supply.

Better Energy Homes (BEH) is a Government scheme which gives fixed cash grants for insulation and heating system upgrades, helping to make your home more comfortable and cheaper to run. It is available to all owners of homes built before 2006. In March 2015 higher grant values and bonus payments were introduced and the scheme is now available for previous applicants to get additional works completed. Over 160,000 homes across Ireland have received grants through BEH to date.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The incentive is in the form of a Cash Grant. Cash grants are fixed, irrespective of home size, though where actual expenditure is lower than the grant value only the lower amount will be paid. Payment is by Electronic Funds Transfer to the applicant’s bank. Visit the <a href="http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Better_energy_homes/">SEAI BEH website</a> or <a href="http://www.chrisreillyconstruction.com/contact.html">contact us</a> for more details.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Home Renovation Incentive scheme announced in Budget 2014</h2><p><em>29 October 2013</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We very much welcome the announcement of the Home Renovation Incentive (HRI) tax relief available to LPT-compliant home owmers. The  <a href="http://www.revenue.ie/en/tax/it/reliefs/hri/index.html">Home Renovation Incentive</a> allows home owners claim a tax credit equal to the Value Added Tax (13.5%) charged on repair, renovation or improvement work carried out on the home owner’s principal private residence. In effect, the home owner will be entitled to claim back the VAT on works. This relief is available on works with a value of €5,000 upwards which are carried out by a tax compliant builder. We are fully tax compliant, VAT registered and hold a current Tax Clearance Certificate, so you can be sure that any works we carry out will quality under the scheme, once the works are of a value of €5,000 or greater.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><a href="http://www.clearsnow.ie">ClearSnow.ie</a></h2><p><em>26 January 2011</em></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are delighted to offer a range of <a href="http://www.clearsnow.ie">snow blowers and winter maintenance equipment</a> to help keep the country moving during the next big snow.

However, it is likely that due to drops in the price of materials can be passed on and your house will cost less to build now than it did in the past.</li>	<li>With the increased standards in insulation and heating technology available, and indeed required under the Building Regulations and Building Energy Ratings (BER), your home will be more <strong>efficient, sustainable</strong> and cost less to run.</li>	<li>With higher availibility of experienced subcontractors, it is likely that your home can be built to a tighter <strong>schedule</strong> than would have been possible in the past.</li>	<li>The SEI are offering <strong>grants</strong> towards renewable heating systems.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All of these things mean that there's no time like the present to dig out those planning documents or go to your local architect and get your dream home designed and drawn up.

Use your timer to set the heating for 30 minutes before you go to bed and the same before you get up. Also set it to come on for just long enough each evening so the chill is gone out of the house when you arrive home from work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><li>Turn down your thermostat. It is widely quoted that turning your thermostat down 1°C can save you 10% in your heating bill. A consistent 20°C is the recommended temperature for homes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><li>Have your boiler serviced annually. If it’s over 10 years old or in poor condition, have it replaced. Modern condensing boilers are much more efficient and help you get more for your money.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><li>Save up to 20% on your heating bill by insulating the attic. A 200mm (8 inch) layer is recommended. If your attic was insulated some time ago check it’s depth and consider adding to it. Just remember to make sure not to insulate under your water tank (heat from below can help stop it freezing in frosty weather), although the sides and top of the tank can be insulated to lower your water heating costs.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><li>Invest in a thermostatic valve for your kitchen radiator, because cooking can cause dramatic temperature variations here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src="images/iStockPhoto/iStock_000005742425XSmall.jpg" alt="Save money through green measures" width="352" height="341" /></p><p>&nbsp;</p><li>Check out ESB Nightsaver rates and use energy-guzzling appliances like dishwashers, washing machines and tumble dryers when electricity is cheapest at night.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><li>Let the sun shine! Sunlight significantly adds to the heat in a room, so when the sun’s out make the most of it and let it in to heat your home. Modern houses tend to have larger areas of glass than less recent houses, which is both a good and a bad thing. It’s good for solar gain but bad for heat loss when the sun isn’t out. Check your windows are at least double glazed and consider replacing or upgrading them if not. Triple glazing is even better, with fantastic insulation and noise reduction properties. Heavy curtains can help trap heat inside in the evening and overnight.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><li>Eliminate drafts by checking your windows and doors are in good condition and a tight fit. Fit draft excluders to doors and letterboxes.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><li>Take in a lodger or a student – the Rent a Room scheme allows you to earn €10,000 per annum tax-free. Digs for a student, 5 days a week with meals, can cost on average €130 per week. A foreign student on a 7 day week basis can pay an average of €150.

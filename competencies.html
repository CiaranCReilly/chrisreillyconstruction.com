We operate in accordance with all relevant Health and Safety guidelines, including acting, where necessary, as Project Supervisor Construction Stage (PSCS) &amp; Project Supervisor Design Process (PSDP) where projects have a design &amp; build element. Along with all our staff being SafePass certified and some staff holding CIF/IOSH Managing Safely in Construction certification, we also work with professionals in the safety industry to ensure we fully comply with current industry best practice. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Value-for-money </h4><p>Offering value to our clients is always top of our priority list, especially in these challening times. When requested to quote for a project, a site visit is always organised so that we fully understand client requirements. At this stage we may be able to offer the benefit of our experience by recommending alterations or changes which may save money. "Value" is one of our key philisophies in industry, and we would be pleased to offer references to this effect.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; </p><h4>Quality </h4><p>We are thoroughly committed to quality. We do not belive quality is just about more paperwork, but rather about the day-to-day committment to achieving excellent results &amp; finishes on site. Our work is often inspected and fully covered by Homebond and as such is generally done to meet or exceed current Homebond House Building Manual standards and Right on the Site publications. We are proud to stand behind all of our completed projects. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Renewable Energy </h4><p>We have experience in installing and commissioning many types of renewable energy systems. Again, we work with professionals with specialist training in this area to facilitate the delivery of efficient, reliable and durable systems. Improving your building's energy efficiency is our speciality. We supply and fit a range of insulation products and renewable energy systems. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h4>Crafts and Trades </h4><p>We work with a large variety of crafts- and tradesmen and have dealings with a pool of experienced, knowledgeable tradespeople.
